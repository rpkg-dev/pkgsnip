The R code adheres to the principles specified in the [Tidyverse Design Guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/) wherever possible and is formatted according to the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (TSG) with the following exceptions:

- Line width is limited to **160 characters**, double the [limit proposed by the TSG](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines) (80 characters is ridiculously little given today's high-resolution wide screen monitors).

- Usage of [magrittr's compound assignment pipe-operator `%<>%`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/compound.html) is desirable[^tsg-capipe].

- Usage of [R's right-hand assignment operator `->`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html) is not allowed[^tsg-rightass].

- R source code is _not_ split over several files as [suggested by the TSG](https://style.tidyverse.org/package-files.html) but instead is (as far as possible) kept in the single file `r if (exists("pkg_metadata")) paste0("Rmd/", pkg_metadata[["Package"]][1], ".Rmd") %>% paste0("[\x60", ., "\x60](", ., ")") else emsg` which is well-structured thanks to its [Markdown support](#r-markdown-format).

As far as possible, these deviations from the TSG plus some additional restrictions are formally specified in the [lintr configuration file](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr#project-configuration) [`.lintr`](.lintr), so lintr can be used right away to check for formatting issues:

```r
pkgpurl::lint_rmd()
```

[^tsg-capipe]: The TSG [explicitly instructs to avoid this operator](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html#assignment-1) – presumably because it's relatively unknown and therefore might be confused with the forward pipe operator `%>%` when skimming code only briefly. I don't consider this to be an actual issue since there aren't many sensible usage patterns of `%>%` at the beginning of a pipe sequence inside a function – I can only think of creating side effects and relying on [R's implicit return of the last evaluated expression](https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html). Therefore – and because I really like the `%<>%` operator – it's usage is welcome.

[^tsg-rightass]: The TSG [explicitly accepts `->` for assignments at the end of a pipe sequence](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html#assignment-1) while Google's R Style Guide [considers this bad practice](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html#right-hand-assignment) because it "makes it harder to see in code where an object is defined". I second the latter.
