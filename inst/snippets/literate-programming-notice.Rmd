This package is written using a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) approach [originally proposed by Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/rlp/). All the `-GEN.R` suffixed R source code found under [`R/`](R/) is generated from their respective [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) counterparts using [`pkgpurl::purl_rmd()`](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/pkgpurl/). Always make changes only to the `.Rmd` files – not the `.R` files – and then run `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` to regenerate the R source code.
