This package's source code is written in the [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file format to facilitate practices commonly referred to as [_literate programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). It allows the actual code to be freely mixed with explanatory and supplementary information in expressive Markdown format instead of having to rely on [`#` comments](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Comments) to explain, annotate or otherwise elaborate on the code.

All the `-GEN.R` suffixed R source code found under [`R/`](R/) is generated from the respective R Markdown counterparts under [`Rmd/`](Rmd/) using [`pkgpurl::purl_rmd()`](https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/pkgs/pkgpurl/)[^lp-yihui]. Always make changes only to the `.Rmd` files – never the `.R` files – and then run `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` to regenerate the R source files.

[^lp-yihui]: This naming convention as well as the very idea to leverage the R Markdown format to author R packages was originally proposed by Yihui Xie. See his excellent [blog post](https://yihui.name/rlp/) for more detailed information about the benefits of literate programming techniques and some practical examples. Note that using `pkgpurl::purl_rmd()` is a less cumbersome alternative to the Makefile approach outlined by him.
